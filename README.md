# Glances websrv
An automated webservice for glances (the easy way)

It's not the most secure way to do it but I use it in my local network or with a vpn.

# Install instructions

Extract the zip in /etc/systemd/system/

Open a shell and run the following

sudo systemctl start glances

sudo systemctl enable glances
